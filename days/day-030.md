# Git Reset Hard

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` present on the Storage server in Stratos DC. This repository was used only for testing purposes, and multiple test commits were pushed by a developer. The team decided to clean the repository completely by removing unnecessary commits and resetting both the **HEAD** and the **branch** to a specific earlier commit with the message `add data.txt file`.

## Requirements

* In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` git repository, reset the commit history so that **only two commits remain**:

  * `initial commit`
  * `add data.txt file`
* Push the updated history to the remote repository.

---

## Steps

### 1. Log in to the Storage Server and Navigate to Repository

```sh
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
```

---

### 2. Verify Current Branch

```sh
sudo git branch
```

```shell
* master
```

---

### 3. Check Commit History

```sh
sudo git log --oneline
```

```shell
5df8099 (HEAD -> master, origin/master) Test Commit10
50fde84 Test Commit9
3c34181 Test Commit8
88573e5 Test Commit7
d84a299 Test Commit6
d8c9a8b Test Commit5
3af6665 Test Commit4
d4078f0 Test Commit3
383933b Test Commit2
6006e51 Test Commit1
9e9d3f9 add data.txt file
697f0b0 initial commit
```

---

### 4. Reset Repository to Required Commit

First reset to the initial commit (optional but safe):

```sh
sudo git reset --hard 697f0b0
```

Then reset to the required commit:

```sh
sudo git reset --hard 9e9d3f9
```

---

### 5. Verify Clean Commit History

```sh
sudo git log --oneline
```

```shell
9e9d3f9 (HEAD -> master) add data.txt file
697f0b0 initial commit
```

✅ Only two commits remain as required.

---

### 6. Force Push Changes to Remote Repository

Since commit history was rewritten, a force push is required:

```sh
sudo git push --force
```

```shell
To /opt/apps.git
 + 5df8099...9e9d3f9 master -> master (forced update)
```

---

## Good to Know

### Git Reset Types

* **Soft** (`--soft`)
  Moves HEAD only, keeps staging area and working directory.
* **Mixed** (`--mixed`, default)
  Moves HEAD and resets staging area.
* **Hard** (`--hard`)
  Resets HEAD, staging area, and working directory completely.

### Important Warnings

* `git reset --hard` permanently removes commits.
* `git push --force` rewrites shared history.
* Use this approach **only for test or controlled repositories**.

### Recovery Options

* View previous HEAD states:

  ```sh
  git reflog
  ```
* Restore from reflog:

  ```sh
  git reset --hard HEAD@{n}
  ```

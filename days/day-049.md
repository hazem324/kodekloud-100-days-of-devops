# Deploy Applications with Kubernetes Deployments

The Nautilus DevOps team is exploring Kubernetes for application management.
In this task, we created a **Deployment** named `nginx` using the image `nginx:latest`.

> The `kubectl` utility on `jump_host` is already configured to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Deployment with the following requirements:

* Deployment name: **nginx**
* Application image: **nginx:latest**
* Number of replicas: **1**
* Expose container port **80**

---

## Steps

### 1. Create the Deployment Manifest

Create a file named:

```bash
nginx-deployment.yaml
```

Add the following content:



---

### 2. Apply the Deployment

Run the following command on `jump_host`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

---

### 3. Verify Deployment Creation

Check if the deployment was successfully created:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

Check the created Pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

---

## Verification Output

You should see:

```bash
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx    1/1     1            1           <time>
```

And:

```bash
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx    1/1     Running   0          <time>
```

# Good to Know 

## Kubernetes Deployments

* **Purpose**: Manage stateless applications declaratively
* **ReplicaSets**: Automatically created and managed by Deployment
* **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime updates
* **Rollback Support**: Revert to previous versions easily

##  Deployment Components Explained

| Component  | Description                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| apiVersion | API group version (`apps/v1`)     |
| kind       | Resource type (Deployment)        |
| metadata   | Resource name and labels          |
| replicas   | Desired number of Pod instances   |
| selector   | Matches Pods using labels         |
| template   | Pod blueprint used to create Pods |
| containers | Container configuration           |

---

##  Labels & Selectors

* Labels are **key-value pairs** attached to resources.
* Selectors match Pods using those labels.
* Selector labels **must match** Pod template labels.
* If they don’t match → Pods will not be managed by the Deployment.

---

##  Best Practices 

* Specify image tag explicitly (`nginx:latest`)
* Keep selector and template labels identical
* Always verify with:

  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```
* Use `--dry-run=client` before applying in production
* Avoid using `latest` in production environments (use fixed versions instead)

# Git Pull and Conflict Resolution

## Overview

Sarah and Max were working on writing and updating stories in a shared Git repository. Both pushed changes to the same `master` branch. When Max attempted to push his updates, Git rejected the push because the remote repository already contained new commits. The task required integrating remote changes correctly and fixing content issues before pushing.

##  Steps

The following steps were executed to resolve the issue and successfully push the changes:

1. **Pull remote changes first** (required because the remote repository had new commits):

```sh
git pull origin master
```

2. **Fix file content issues**:

* Corrected the typo `Mooose` → `Mouse`
* Ensured `story-index.txt` contains only story titles
* Removed any invalid separator lines such as `====`

3. **Stage the changes**:

```sh
git add *
```

4. **Commit the fixes**:

```sh
git commit -m "mouse"
```

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository**:

```sh
git push origin master
```

## Git Concepts Explained

### git fetch vs git pull

* **git fetch**

  * Downloads new commits from the remote repository
  * Does **not** change your local branch or files
  * Safe way to inspect changes before integrating

* **git pull**

  * Combines two actions: `git fetch` + `git merge`
  * Downloads remote changes and immediately integrates them into your current branch
  * May create merge commits or conflicts

**In short:**

> `fetch` only downloads changes, while `pull` downloads and applies them.

### git rebase (Simple Explanation)

* Re-applies your local commits on top of another branch
* Produces a linear history
* Rewrites commit history

**Important rule:**

* Use rebase on **feature branches**
* Avoid rebase on **shared branches like master**

In this task, `git pull` (merge-based integration) was the correct and safest choice.

## Good to Know

### Merge Conflicts

* **Cause**: Same lines modified by different users
* **Detection**: Git cannot auto-merge changes
* **Resolution**: Manual editing is required

### Conflict Markers

* `<<<<<<< HEAD` – Local changes
* `=======` – Separator
* `>>>>>>> branch-name` – Incoming changes

To resolve conflicts:

* Remove the markers
* Keep the correct content

# Setup Git Repository on Storage Server

The Nautilus development team requested the DevOps team to set up a Git repository for a new application development project. This repository is hosted on the **Storage Server** in the **Stratos DC**.

The objective is to install Git using `yum` and create a **bare Git repository** with the exact required name.

---

## Requirements

* Install Git using `yum`
* Create a bare repository at the following path:

```
/opt/apps.git
```

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Login to the Storage Server

```bash
ssh natasha@<storage-server-ip>
```

---

### 2. Update the System (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

---

### 3. Install Git Using yum

```bash
sudo yum install -y git
```

Verify installation:

```bash
git --version
```

---

### 4. Create a Bare Git Repository

```bash
sudo git init --bare /opt/apps.git
```

If successful, Git will respond with:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /opt/apps.git/
```

## Good to Know

# Git Repository Types

Git supports different types of repositories depending on their purpose. The two most common types are **Working Repositories** and **Bare Repositories**.

## Working Repository

A **working repository** contains a working directory with checked-out project files that developers can modify.

### Characteristics

* Includes a **working directory**
* Contains project files and a `.git` directory
* Used for **development and testing**
* Allows editing, committing, and branching

### Use Case

* Local development on a developer’s machine

## Bare Repository

A **bare repository** contains **only Git metadata** and does not have a working directory.

### Characteristics

* No working directory
* Stores commits, branches, and tags
* Prevents conflicts during push operations
* Optimized for server usage

### Use Case

* Central repository for **team collaboration**
* Acts as a shared source of truth for the project

---

## Purpose of Bare Repositories

* Enable **collaboration** between multiple developers
* Serve as a **central hub** for push and pull operations
* Commonly used in enterprise and DevOps environments

---

## Repository Location

Bare repositories are typically stored on **servers** and accessed remotely.























### What Is a Bare Repository?

* A **bare repository** does **not** contain a working directory
* It only stores Git metadata (commits, branches, tags)
* Typically used as a **central/shared repository** on servers


### Why Use a Bare Repository?

*  Prevents file conflicts during push operations
*  Ideal for collaboration between multiple developers
*  Standard practice for server-side Git repositories
*  Lightweight and secure

---

### Git Repository Naming

* Bare repositories usually end with `.git`
* This helps distinguish them from working repositories

### Typical Use Case

Developers can clone the repository like this:

```bash
git clone user@storage-server:/opt/apps.git
```

#  MariaDB Troubleshooting

##  Task Description

A **critical production issue** was detected in the **Nautilus application** running in **Stratos Datacenter**.  
The application failed to connect to its database.

After investigation, it was confirmed that the **MariaDB service was down** on the database server.

---

##  Problem Summary

- Application cannot connect to the database
- `mariadb.service` is in **failed** state
- MariaDB logs show **InnoDB storage engine errors**
- Root cause identified as **incorrect file ownership and permissions**

---

##  Root Cause Analysis

MariaDB logs showed the following errors:

```
[ERROR] InnoDB: Operating system error number 13 in a file operation
[ERROR] InnoDB: The error means mysqld does not have the access rights to the directory
[ERROR] Cannot open datafile './ibtmp1'
[ERROR] Unknown/unsupported storage engine: InnoDB
```

➡️ These errors indicate that the **mysqld process does not have permission** to access the MariaDB data directory.

##  Steps

### 1. Login to the Database Server

```bash
ssh peter@stdb01
```

### 2. Check MariaDB Service Status

```bash
systemctl status mariadb.service
```

### 3. Examine MariaDB Logs

```bash
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
```

### 4. Correct Directory Ownership

```bash
sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
```

### 5. Set Correct Permissions

```bash
sudo chmod -R 750 /var/lib/mysql
```

### 6. Check SELinux (If Applicable)

```bash
sudo setenforce 0
```

### 7. Start MariaDB Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

### 8. Verify Service Status

```bash
systemctl status mariadb
```

Expected result:

```
Active: active (running)
Status: "Taking your SQL requests now..."
```

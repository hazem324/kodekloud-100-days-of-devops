Yes, I know exactly what you mean 👍
You want the **README to be generic/reusable**, while still matching **the same steps you actually performed**.

Below is the **final corrected README.md** with:

* ✅ `your_password` instead of the real password
* ✅ `database_name` instead of the real DB name
* ✅ Same commands, same flow, same screenshots
* ✅ Only **two sections**, exactly like your example

# 🐘 Install and Configure PostgreSQL

The Nautilus application development team is planning to deploy a newly developed application on **Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC**.
The application uses **PostgreSQL** as its database backend.

The PostgreSQL database server is **already installed** on the Nautilus database server.
This task focuses on **creating a database user and database**, without restarting the PostgreSQL service.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Fix the Task

### 1️⃣ Login to the Database Server

```bash
ssh user@db_host
```

---

### 2️⃣ Switch to PostgreSQL System User

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres
```

---

### 3️⃣ Open PostgreSQL Interactive Shell

```bash
psql
```

All database commands are executed **inside the PostgreSQL prompt**.

---

### 4️⃣ Create Database User

```sql
CREATE USER database_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
```

📌 **Explanation**

* Creates a PostgreSQL role with login access
* This user will be used by the application to connect to the database

---

### 5️⃣ Create Application Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

📌 **Explanation**

* Creates a dedicated database for the application
* The database is empty and ready for use

---

### 6️⃣ Grant Full Privileges on Database

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO database_user;
```

📌 **Explanation**

* Grants full access to the database for the application user
* Allows creating, modifying, and managing database objects

---

### 7️⃣ Exit PostgreSQL

```sql
\q
```

Then exit the postgres user session:

```bash
exit
```

✅ **PostgreSQL service was NOT restarted**, as required.

---

## 📘 Good to Know

### PostgreSQL Roles

* PostgreSQL uses **roles** instead of separate users and groups
* A role with `LOGIN` permission acts as a database user

### Database Privileges

* `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES` provides full control over the database
* Permissions can be restricted later for better security

### Best Practices

* Use one database user per application
* Never expose real passwords in documentation
* Follow the principle of least privilege in production

---

✅ This version is **clean, reusable, and documentation-ready**.
If you want, I can also:

* Convert it to **KodeKloud-style minimal README**
* Align it with your **100 Days of DevOps** repo naming
* Add a short **task summary section**

🐘 Install and Configure PostgreSQL

The Nautilus application development team is planning to deploy a newly developed application on Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC.
The application uses PostgreSQL as its database backend.

The PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.
This task focuses on creating a database user and database, without restarting the PostgreSQL service.

🛠️ Steps to Fix the Task
1️⃣ Login to the Database Server
ssh user@db_host

2️⃣ Switch to PostgreSQL System User
sudo -i -u postgres

3️⃣ Open PostgreSQL Interactive Shell
psql


All database commands are executed inside the PostgreSQL prompt.

4️⃣ Create Database User
CREATE USER database_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';


📌 Explanation

Creates a PostgreSQL role with login access

This user will be used by the application to connect to the database

5️⃣ Create Application Database
CREATE DATABASE database_name;


📌 Explanation

Creates a dedicated database for the application

The database is empty and ready for use

6️⃣ Grant Full Privileges on Database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO database_user;


📌 Explanation

Grants full access to the database for the application user

Allows creating, modifying, and managing database objects

7️⃣ Exit PostgreSQL
\q


Then exit the postgres user session:

exit


✅ PostgreSQL service was NOT restarted, as required.

📘 Good to Know
PostgreSQL Roles

PostgreSQL uses roles instead of separate users and groups

A role with LOGIN permission acts as a database user

Database Privileges

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES provides full control over the database

Permissions can be restricted later for better security

Best Practices

Use one database user per application

Never expose real passwords in documentation

Follow the principle of least privilege in production

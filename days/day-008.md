# Install Ansible Version 4.8.0 on Jump Host

## Task Description

The Nautilus DevOps team has decided to adopt Ansible as their primary automation and configuration management tool due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and minimal prerequisites. To begin testing Ansible, the jump host will be used as the Ansible control node to manage and automate tasks on other servers in the environment.

### Objective

Install Ansible version **4.8.0** on the jump host using `pip3` only. Ensure the Ansible binary is available globally so that all users on the system can run Ansible commands.

## Steps to Complete the Task

Run the following commands **on the Jump Host**.

### 1. Update System Packages

Ensure the system is up to date:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
2. Install Python 3 and pip3
Ansible installed via pip requires Python:
Bashsudo dnf install python3 python3-pip -y
3. Remove Existing Ansible Packages (If Any)
To avoid conflicts with older or OS-installed versions:
Bashsudo pip3 uninstall ansible ansible-base -y
4. Install Ansible 4.8.0 Using pip3
Install Ansible system-wide so it is available to all users:
Bashsudo pip3 install ansible==4.8.0
5. Verify the Installation
Check the Ansible version:
Bashansible --version
Check full package details:
Bashpip3 show ansible
Note:
The ansible --version command displays the ansible-core version.
For Ansible 4.8.0, the core engine version is ansible-core 2.11.12.
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, provisioning, and orchestration. It is radically simple, agentless (no software agents required on managed nodes), and uses human-readable YAML for defining automation tasks.
Ansible in DevOps
In DevOps, Ansible plays a central role by bridging development and operations teams through automation. It enables:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Treating infrastructure configurations like application code.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automating deployments and environment provisioning.
Consistent and repeatable environments: Reducing configuration drift across development, testing, and production.
Faster delivery: Automating repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on innovation.

Ansible is widely used for multi-tier application deployments, cloud provisioning, network automation, and orchestrating complex workflows in modern DevOps pipelines.
Good to Know
Ansible Fundamentals

Agentless: No software installation required on managed nodes.
SSH-based: Uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows) for secure communication.
YAML Playbooks: Automation tasks written in human-readable YAML format.
Idempotent: Tasks are safe to run multiple times — they only make changes if needed.
Push-based: The control node pushes configurations to managed nodes (unlike pull-based tools).
Modular: Extensive library of built-in modules for common tasks (e.g., yum, copy, service).

Ansible Components

Control Node: The machine running Ansible (e.g., jump host).
Managed Nodes: Target servers being configured (no agent required).
Inventory: List of managed nodes (static or dynamic, often in INI or YAML format).
Playbooks: YAML files defining the desired state and automation tasks.
Modules: Reusable scripts performing specific actions (e.g., yum, copy, service).
Roles: Organized, reusable collections of tasks, variables, and templates.
Facts: System information gathered from managed nodes (e.g., OS, IP, hardware details).

Additional Key Points

Collections: Since Ansible 2.10+, functionality is extended via collections (bundled modules, plugins, etc.).
Python Requirement: Control node requires Python 3.6+.
Versioning: The "ansible" package (e.g., 4.8.0) bundles ansible-core with community collections.
Ad-hoc Commands: Quick one-liners for simple tasks (e.g., ansible all -m ping).
Idempotency Advantage: Ensures reliability in production — re-running playbooks won't cause unintended changes.
Community & Ecosystem: Backed by Red Hat, with a vast collection of roles on Ansible Galaxy.

This setup provides a solid foundation for exploring Ansible's capabilities in configuration management and automation.

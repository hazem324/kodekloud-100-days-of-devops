# 📦 Install Ansible Version 4.8.0 on Jump Host

## 📌 Task Description

The **Nautilus DevOps team** has decided to adopt **Ansible** as their primary automation and configuration management tool due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and minimal prerequisites.

To begin testing Ansible, the **Jump Host** will be used as the **Ansible Control Node** to manage and automate tasks on other servers in the environment.

### 🎯 Objective

- Install **Ansible version 4.8.0**
- Use **pip3 only** (no OS package manager)
- Ensure the **Ansible binary is available globally** so all users can run Ansible commands

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete the Task

Run the following commands **on the Jump Host**.

---

### 1️⃣ Update System Packages

Ensure the system is up to date:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
2️⃣ Install Python 3 and pip3
Ansible installed via pip requires Python:

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip -y
3️⃣ Remove Existing Ansible Packages (If Any)
To avoid conflicts with older or OS-installed versions:

bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 uninstall ansible ansible-base -y
4️⃣ Install Ansible 4.8.0 Using pip3
Install Ansible system-wide so it is available to all users:

bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install ansible==4.8.0
5️⃣ Verify the Installation
Check the Ansible version:

bash
Copy code
ansible --version
Check full package details:

bash
Copy code
pip3 show ansible
ℹ️ Note
The ansible --version command displays the ansible-core version, not the top-level Ansible package version.
For Ansible 4.8.0, the core engine version is ansible-core 2.11.12.

🧠 What Is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT tasks such as:

Configuration management

Application deployment

Provisioning

Orchestration

It is designed to be simple, agentless, and secure, using human-readable YAML files to define automation tasks.

🚀 Ansible in DevOps
In DevOps, Ansible plays a key role by enabling automation across the entire infrastructure lifecycle:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure configurations are managed like application code.

CI/CD Enablement
Automates deployments and environment provisioning.

Consistency & Reliability
Ensures identical configurations across dev, test, and production environments.

Faster Delivery
Reduces manual work and human error through automation.

Ansible is widely used for:

Multi-tier application deployments

Cloud provisioning

Network automation

Orchestrating complex workflows in modern DevOps pipelines

💡 Good to Know — Ansible Essentials
🔹 Ansible Fundamentals
Agentless
No software installation required on managed nodes.

SSH-based
Uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows) for secure communication.

YAML Playbooks
Automation tasks written in human-readable YAML format.

Idempotent
Tasks can be run multiple times safely; changes are applied only when needed.

Push-based
The control node pushes configurations to managed nodes.

Modular
Extensive library of built-in modules for common tasks.

🔹 Core Ansible Components
Control Node
The machine running Ansible (Jump Host).

Managed Nodes
Target servers being configured (no agent required).

Inventory
List of managed nodes (static or dynamic).

Playbooks
YAML files defining desired state and automation logic.

Modules
Reusable units of work (e.g. yum, copy, service).

Roles
Structured, reusable collections of tasks and configurations.

Facts
System information gathered from managed nodes for conditional logic.

🔹 Additional Key Points
Collections
Since Ansible 2.10+, functionality is extended via collections.

Python Requirement
Control node requires Python 3.6+.

Versioning Model

ansible (e.g. 4.8.0): Collections + plugins

ansible-core: Execution engine

Ad-hoc Commands
Quick one-liners for simple tasks:

bash
Copy code
ansible all -m ping
Idempotency Advantage
Ensures safe and repeatable automation in production.

Ecosystem
Backed by Red Hat with a large community and Ansible Galaxy roles.

✅ Final Result
Ansible 4.8.0 is successfully installed on the Jump Host using pip3,
and the Ansible binary is available globally for all users, ready for automation and configuration management tasks.

# Execute Rollback in Kubernetes Cluster

Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer reported a bug related to this release. The objective was to revert the deployment to the previous stable revision.

There is an existing deployment named `nginx-deployment`.

---

## Objective

Rollback the deployment **nginx-deployment** to its previous revision.

---

## Steps

### 1. Verify Deployment Exists

```sh
kubectl get deploy
```

Output:

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           79s
```

This confirms the deployment is running.

### 2. Execute Rollback

To revert to the previous revision:

```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Output:

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back
```

This confirms that the rollback operation was triggered successfully.

### 3. Verify Rollout Status

```sh
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

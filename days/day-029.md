# Manage Git Pull Requests

The Nautilus application development team wants to ensure that **no one pushes code directly to the `master` branch**, as it represents the final and approved version of the code.
All changes must go through a **feature branch**, be **reviewed**, and then **merged using a Pull Request**.

Max has written his story about **The Fox and the Grapes** and pushed it to a separate branch. The task is to merge this work into `master` following the proper review workflow using the Gitea UI.

## Steps

### 1. Login into Storage Server

```sh
ssh max@<storage-server>
```

Password:

```text
Max_pass123
```

### 2. Move into the cloned repository

```sh
cd ~
ls
cd story-blog
```

### 3. Verify repository contents and commit history

```sh
ls
git log
```

Confirm:

* Sarah’s story exists
* Max’s commit message: `Added fox-and-grapes story`
* Author information is correct
* Max’s commit is **not** in the `master` branch

### 4. Verify branches

```sh
git branch
git branch -r
```

Ensure:

* `story/fox-and-grapes` branch exists
* Remote branch `origin/story/fox-and-grapes` is present

### 5. Open Gitea UI and login as Max

* Click the **Gitea UI** button from the top bar
* Login credentials:

  * **Username:** `max`
  * **Password:** `Max_pass123`

### 6. Create a Pull Request

In the Gitea UI:

* Navigate to **Pull Requests**
* Click **New Pull Request**

Fill in the following details:

* **Pull from (source):** `story/fox-and-grapes`
* **Merge into (destination):** `master`
* **Title:** `Added fox-and-grapes story`
* **Description:** Leave empty

Click **Create Pull Request**.

### 7. Assign Tom as Reviewer (Important)

On the Pull Request page:

* Locate **Reviewers** on the right sidebar
* Click the ⚙️ (gear icon)
* Add **tom** as reviewer

> ⚠️ Do NOT add Tom as an Assignee.
> The review request must be under **Reviewers**.

### 8. Logout as Max and login as Tom

Logout from Gitea, then login with:

* **Username:** `tom`
* **Password:** `Tom_pass123`

### 9. Review the Pull Request as Tom

* Open the Pull Request titled **Added fox-and-grapes story**
* Review the changes
* Click **Approve**

### 10. Merge the Pull Request as Tom

* Click **Merge Pull Request**
* Keep the default merge commit message
* Confirm the merge

The Pull Request status should now be **Merged**.

## Good to Know?

### Pull Request Fundamentals

* **No Direct Push**: Prevents unreviewed changes in `master`
* **Feature Branches**: Developers work independently
* **Review Process**: Enforces code quality and collaboration
* **Audit Trail**: Clear history of who wrote, reviewed, and merged code


### Reviewer vs Assignee (Very Important)

* **Reviewer**: Required for approval (used by automated checks)
* **Assignee**: Optional, does NOT count as a review
* Always add reviewers explicitly for PR validation


### Benefits of This Workflow

* **Improved Code Quality**
* **Accountability**
* **Team Collaboration**
* **Safe Production Branch (`master`)**


### Final Result

* Max’s story was merged into `master`
* Tom reviewed and approved the changes
* The repository follows best practices for Git-based collaboration

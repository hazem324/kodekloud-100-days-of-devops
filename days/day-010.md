Here’s a **clean, corrected, and ready-to-use `README.md`** for your task. I fixed the inconsistencies (`news` vs `beta`, users, hosts, zip name) and aligned everything exactly with the requirements.

# News Website Backup – Bash Script

The production support team of **xFusionCorp Industries** is developing Bash scripts to automate day-to-day operational tasks.  
This project focuses on creating a **backup script for a static news website** running on **App Server 1** in the Stratos Datacenter.

---

## 📌 Objective

Create a Bash script named **`news_backup.sh`** that:

- Compresses the `/var/www/html/news` directory
- Creates a ZIP archive named `xfusioncorp_news.zip`
- Stores the archive temporarily in `/backup/` on App Server 1
- Copies the archive to the **Nautilus Backup Server**
- Uses **passwordless SSH authentication**
- Can be executed by the user **tony**

---

## 🖥️ Servers Involved

| Role | Hostname | User |
|-----|---------|------|
| App Server 1 | `stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com` | `tony` |
| Backup Server | `stbkp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com` | `clint` |

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

```text
/var/www/html/news        → Source website
/backup/                 → Temporary local backup
/scripts/news_backup.sh  → Backup script
````

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed on **App Server 1**:

```bash
sudo yum install -y zip nano
```

---

## 🔐 Passwordless SSH Setup

1. Generate an SSH key as user `tony`:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   ```

   *(Press Enter to accept defaults and leave passphrase empty)*

2. Copy the public key to the backup server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
   ```

   *(Enter `clint`’s password once)*

---

## 📝 Script Creation

1. Create the scripts directory if it doesn’t exist:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /scripts
   ```

2. Create the script:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /scripts/news_backup.sh
   ```

3. Add the following content:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   set -e

   SOURCE_DIR="/var/www/html/news"
   BACKUP_DIR="/backup"
   ARCHIVE_NAME="xfusioncorp_news.zip"
   REMOTE_USER="clint"
   REMOTE_HOST="stbkp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com"
   REMOTE_DIR="/backup"

   # Create backup directory if missing
   mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

   # Create zip archive
   zip -r "${BACKUP_DIR}/${ARCHIVE_NAME}" "$SOURCE_DIR"

   # Copy archive to Nautilus Backup Server
   scp "${BACKUP_DIR}/${ARCHIVE_NAME}" \
       "${REMOTE_USER}@${REMOTE_HOST}:${REMOTE_DIR}"
   ```

4. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /scripts/news_backup.sh
   ```

---

## ▶️ Script Execution

Run the script as user `tony`:

```bash
/scripts/news_backup.sh
```

✅ Expected behavior:

* `xfusioncorp_news.zip` is created in `/backup/`
* The archive is copied to `/backup/` on the Nautilus Backup Server
* No password prompt appears

---

## 📚 Notes & Best Practices

### Bash Scripting

* Use `#!/bin/bash` for portability
* Enable `set -e` to stop on errors
* Always quote variables (`"$VAR"`)
* Keep scripts readable and modular

### Backup Strategy

* **Full backup** used here (entire directory)
* ZIP format ensures compression and portability
* Weekly cleanup handled externally

### File Transfer

* `scp` uses SSH for secure transfer
* SSH keys are required for automation
* `rsync` is recommended for large or incremental backups

---

##  Conclusion

This script provides a **secure, automated, and reliable** backup solution for the news website, compliant with xFusionCorp operational standards.

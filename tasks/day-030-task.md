# Day 30 - Git hard reset

## Task Description

The Nautilus team needs to clean up a test repository by removing unwanted commits and resetting the branch to a stable state.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Repository Scope

* Local path:

```
/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
```

---

### 2. History Cleanup

* Reset the branch so that only the following commits remain:

```
initial commit
add data.txt file
```

* The HEAD must point to the commit with message:

```
add data.txt file
```

---

### 3. Synchronization

* Push the rewritten history to the remote repository.

---

## Expected Result

* The repository history contains only the two required commits.
* The branch reflects the cleaned state on the remote server.
